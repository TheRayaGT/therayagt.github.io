</div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
    In Our Prime is a 2022 South Korean film starring Choi Min-Sik and Kim Dong-Hwi, who played the roles of Lee Hak-Seong and Han Ji-Woo respectively. The film unfolds against the backdrop of Donghun Academy, a prestigious institution in South Korea, where the pursuit of academic excellence is a way of life. At the heart of the story is Ji-Woo, a student grappling with the challenges of his studies, particularly in Mathematics. The subject becomes a formidable obstacle on his academic journey. In a system where proficiency in Mathematics is paramount for high school admission, Ji-Woo finds himself at a crossroads. His homeroom and Mathematics teacher, Mr. Kim, notices Ji-Woo's struggles and, with <i>genuine concern</i>, suggests the possibility of transferring to a different school. The weight of this decision hangs heavily on Ji-Woo as he contemplates his future.
</div>


    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        One night, Ji-Woo's roommates requested him to sneak out to buy soju and food. Ji-Woo complied but their covert operation was thwarted by the school's security guard, Hak-Seong. Ji-Woo was punished in front of the class class. When Mr. Kim, pressed Ji-Woo for the identities of his accomplices, Ji-Woo chose silence over betrayal. As such, he was expelled from the dormitory and went back to live with his mum, a widow. Not wanting to make her worried, Ji-Woo told his mum that he only wanted to return home to see her and had to return to school later. Ji-Woo hides outside the abandoned laboratory in the school but was discovered by Hak-Seong. In a moment of compassion, Hak-Seong allowed him to spend the night in his workplace. Ji-Woo, deep in slumber on the couch, accidentally nudged his schoolbag and his worksheets fell out of it. Hak-Seong picks them up and glances.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        At daybreak, Hak-Seong kicked Ji-Woo out of the room. The story transitions to Mathematics class with Mr. Kim. Ji-Woo was surprised that his homework was completed by Hak-Seong and all the answers were correct. Desperate to find out more, Ji-Woo thanked Hak-Seong profusely and asked him to teach him how to solve the homework questions but was kicked out again. In the study room, Ji-Woo came to know that even his classmates’ private tutors struggled with the intricate Mathematics problems, highlighting Hak-Seong's exceptional mastery.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        After relentless attempts of pleading Hak-Seong to teach Ji-Woo, the former finally agreed, albeit under strict terms. The conditions were clear: their lessons were to remain a secret, discussions were limited solely to Mathematics, and Hak-Seong’s disinterest in Ji-Woo’s grades. Hak-Seong requested to buy him a carton of strawberry milk for lessons. They agreed to meet at the abandoned laboratory. During the first lesson, Hak-Seong presented Ji-Woo with a tricky Geometry problem. It is as follows:
    </div>


    <div style="width: 100%; background-color: #423d73; color: #fff; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0;padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;  margin-bottom: 32px">
        <a style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"><div style="text-align: left;">A triangle has vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$. $\angle A =90^\circ$ and $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles. The height is 6 units and the base $BC$ is 10 units. Calculate the area.</div></a>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 46%; text-align: justify;">
        Ji-Woo answered '30 square units' three times. He assumed that 6 units was the length of the <i>perpendicular height</i> corresponding to the base $BC$. As such, he thought
        that the area was $\frac{1}{2}\times 6 \times 10=30$ square units. Clearly, the assumption is false. Hak-Seong drew a circle that passed through the points $A$, $B$ and $C$, which resulted
        in $BC$ being the diameter of the circle. As such, by Thales' Theorem, or Singaporean students would commonly quote it as 'existence of right angle in a semicircle',
        one can deduce that the radius of the circle is 5 units. As such, the actual perpendicular height (this is actually the radius) is 5 units! Hence, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}\times 5\times 10=25$ square units.
    </div>
    <div style="width: 52%;">
    <img src="\NEW\In Our Prime 3.jpg" style="width: 600px; margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>
</div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
    The study of Mathematics is beautiful. As such, I feel that not only do we need to justify that a correct concept is correct, but we also need to acknowledge that wrong concepts are wrong. But, is the question correct in the first place? It isn't! Such a triangle $\triangle ABC$ cannot exist, simply because it contradicts that the radii of the same circle are different.
    </div>

    <div style="width: 100%; background-color: #423d73; color: #fff; text-align: center; padding: 5px; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 32px">
        <a style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"><div style="text-align: justify;">It's because you were so blind to solving problems. Finding the answer is important but knowing what the problem is even more important. You can't get the right answer from an incorrect probolem. It's about the process of finding the solution. That's Math, got that? <i>Epsilon</i>.</div></a>
      <div style="text-align: right;">~ Lee Hak-Seong</div>
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        Epsilon is no alien to University students who have taken an introductory course in Calculus. It is denoted by $\varepsilon$, or $\epsilon$, but I prefer using the former. Interestingly, the term ‘epsilon’ takes on a dual role; it not only represents a mathematical concept but also bears a striking resemblance to the word ‘excellent’. In a cinematic flashback, the scene transitions to the award ceremony of the 23rd International Mathematical Olympiad in 1982. Hungarian Mathematician Paul Erdős expressed his reverence and presented the two winners with a pen each. Hak-Seong was one of them, and the other was Oh Jung-Nam from South Korea. Hak-Seong was actually a defector from North Korea in search for better life in the south. During the flashback, what I presumed epsilon meant was excellent, or it could also mean ‘something small’, just like in the formal definition of a limit (Calculus students should know this as the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit).
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        Ji-Woo started buying strawberry milk frequently from a convenience store, for which he got noticed by one of his classmates, Park Bo-Ram (Jo Yun-Seo). During another one of his lessons with Hak-Seong, Ji-Woo is presented with the following challenging problem:
    </div>

    <div style="width: 100%; background-color: #423d73; color: #fff; text-align: left; padding: 5px 0; padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        <a style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none;">Find $S_{10}$, given that \[S_m=\frac{a_1}{1+a_1}+\frac{a_1a_2}{(1+a_1)(1+a_2)}+\ldots+\frac{a_1a_2\ldots a_m}{(1+a_1)(1+a_2)\ldots(1+a_m)}.\]</a>
    </div>
    
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 28%; text-align: justify;">
        I tried to use Google Translate to the best of my ability but was unable to reproduce the problem in English. There should be some information about the sequence $\left\{a_n\right\}$ as well. To anyone who knows what the problem on the board is exactly, feel free to contact me and we can discuss over it. Hak-Seong takss Ji-Woo to go through a laborious task which involved intense calculations and they filled up the chalkboard. After Ji-Woo claims to have solved the problem, Hak-Seong shows him a set of notes, and Ji-Woo uttered '1.414'. These are precisely the first few digits of $\sqrt{2}$, but Hak-Seong reveals that the author of the notes calculated 38 decimals of $\sqrt{2}$ by hand. The author was none other than renowned German Mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who is infamous for proposing the Riemann Hypothesis.
    <br><br> I was particularly unfamiliar with the so-called Riemann's computation of $\sqrt{2}$. Though I am not a big fan of Numerical Analysis (which is a branch of Mathematics that deals with approximating roots of equations, area and volume, as well as solutions to differential equations), I do appreciate a formula that was indepedently discovered by Newton and Raphson (known as the Newton-Raphson Method) which allows one to approximate the roots of equations.

    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
    When using the Newton-Raphson Method, one can consider $f(x)=x^2-2$ (since $\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $f$), which implies that $f'(x)=2x$, in order to obtain an approximation of $\sqrt{2}$ to a desired frequency. The moment Hak-Seong mentioned 'Riemann', an inquisitive Ji-Woo replied 'Riemann? As in Riemann Hypothesis?' It seemed as if Ji-Woo had a depth of knowledge for Mathematics when he blabbered that the Riemann Hypothesis is a hypothesis about prime numbers.

        <a style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"><div style="text-align: justify;">The real question is, why did this world-renowned Mathematician work on a useless calculation, such as the square root of 2?

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
      I particularly loved the following scene. It showed some books on Calculus, as well as Probability and Statistics on a desk. The camera delicately captured the scene: a dedicated Ji-Woo, immersed in his studies, meticulously absorbing the content of the books laid out before him. As the camera moved out of the window, the leaves on the trees outside the laboratory underwent a subtle transformation, shifting from the vibrant hues of green to the warm golden tones of autumn. Each leaf, gently cascaded to the surface. For some reason, this OST (called ‘1 Month’) is great for studying.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        As the weeks rolled on, Ji-Woo received disheartening news: a close friend who was a welfare student, had transferred back to his previous school. His friend’s departure came with a bitter revelation – the sacrifice of coming to Donghun Academy seemed futile in his eyes. In an attempt to console Ji-Woo, Bo-Ram, who shared a similar background but hailed from a well-off family, tried to empathise. However, the chasm between their circumstances remained evident. While both were technically welfare students due to familial challenges, Bo-Ram’s situation differed significantly from Ji-Woo's. Their conversation was abruptly interrupted by Bo-Ram’s mother who came to pick her up. In the car, she scolded Bo-Ram for associating with Ji-Woo, drawing a stark contrast between their worlds. Though Bo-Ram’s parents were divorced, she didn’t face the same financial struggles as Ji-Woo. Later that evening, Bo-Ram found herself being escorted by her mother to meet Mr. Kim, who had been enlisted as her private tutor for the upcoming Pythagoras' Award. This competition was to determine students' grades and secure their admission into high school, replacing the traditional final examinations.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        At night, Ji-Woo confided in Hak-Seong, lamenting his friend's departure and questioning the validity of Mr. Kim's suggestion to transfer. In response, Hak-Seong said the following:
    </div>

    <div style="width: 100%; background-color: #423d73; color: #fff; text-align: center; padding: 5px; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 32px">
        <a style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none;"><div style="text-align: justify;">Don't believe anything that isn't proven. That's what Mathematicians do. Look here. What do you need the most to be good at Math? Smart people give up first. Those who rely on effort give up next. It is courage. Rather than getting angry or give up when you can't solve a problem, you say to yourself that this is really tough and you'll try again tomorrow. That's mathematical courage. Those with composed and firm personalities prevail in the end.</div> </a>

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 38%; text-align: justify;">
        Hak-Seong provided invaluable feedback on the problems Ji-Woo did. Despite the ratio of incorrect to correct answers, Hak-Seong acknowledged Ji-Woo's potential and commended his efforts in attempting to solve the problems. Before parting ways, Hak-Seong offered words of encouragement, urging Ji-Woo to ‘prove it, whether transferring is right or not,’ hinting at the importance of perseverance and self-belief. Upon Ji-Woo's return to the dormitory after his suspension, he found a surprising gesture from Bo-Ram – a carton of strawberry milk accompanied by an apology note. However, little did he know that Bo-Ram later followed him secretly to the abandoned laboratory, where she discovered Hak-Seong tutoring him. During their lesson, Ji-Woo was engrossed in solving a Geometry problem involving a trapezium and two circles. Grateful that Hak-Seong took care of Ji-Woo, Bo-Ram expressed her gratitude and asked if she could occasionally visit. Hak-Seong, appreciative of Bo-Ram's concern for Ji-Woo, agreed but emphasised the need to keep their interactions confidential.

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        In a conversation on another evening, Ji-Woo questioned Hak-Seong about his deep devotion to Mathematics. Hak-Seong revealed that his initial motivation stemmed from the pursuit of a scholarship and the desire to support his family. However, as he delved deeper into the subject, his passion for Mathematics grew exponentially. He shared with Ji-Woo the beauty of Euler's Identity. That is, the equation \[e^{i\pi}+1=0.\]
    </div>

    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
    <img src="\NEW\In Our Prime 7.jpg" style="display: inline-block; width: 540px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
</div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
            One should know that $e\approx 2.71828$ is known as Euler's number (many confuse this with Euler's constant $\gamma$ but as the name suggests, they mean different things). Hak-Seong mentions that <i>all sloping lines can be expressed with this</i>. An overlay of a man pulling apart cheese as he eats appears on the screen. What Hak-Seong actually means precisely is that sloping lines can generally be modelled by the equation \[y=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}=\operatorname{cosh}x,\] where $\operatorname{cosh}x$ denotes the hyperbolic cosine function. Well, actually, not all curves look like this. Some may be parabolic like $y=ax^2$ (or another of its variants). Having said that, this is a prime example of Euler's Nummber $e$ in our everyday life.
    </div>


    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
    <img src="\NEW\In Our Prime 8.jpg" style="display: inline-block; width: 540px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
</div>


    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        Just like $e$, $\pi\approx 3.14$ is another important mathematical constant. It is closely related to circles. In fact, it is defined to be the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter. Hak-Seong mentions that $\pi$ is a 'circular constant'. It then shows the formula for the volume of a cylinder $\pi r^2h$, as well as the graph of $y=\operatorname{sin}3\pi x$. The last instance of $\pi$ in a formula is shown as follows: \[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\ldots=\frac{\pi^2}{6}\]
        This is the famous Basel problem, for which the exact value of the infinite series was established by the great Leonhard Euler in 1734.

</div>


    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        Lastly, Hak-Seong talks about the imaginary unit, $i=\sqrt{-1}$. It seems as if $i$ does not have applications in the real world since we can only visualise real numbers. However, $i$ is used in a branch of Mathematics called Signal Processing. This is particularly useful in cellular and wireless technologies!

1 is the smallest natural number (some include 0 in the set of natural numbers though but to avoid confusion, one can consider the set of natural numbers to be the set of positive integers instead), whereas the <i>paradoxical number</i> 0 is used to express ‘nil’. Indeed, the beauty of Euler's Identity lies in its ability to harmoniously unite five seemingly unrelated and essential mathematical constants. In fact, it is regarded as the ‘most beautiful equation’ in Mathematics.    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
Hak-Seong persuaded Ji-Woo to invite Bo-Ram into the laboratory, where they collaborated on a musical piece inspired by the mathematical constant $\pi$. In this composition, each digit of $\pi$ corresponded to a note on the piano, creating a harmonious melody that showcased the beauty of Mathematics.

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 46%; text-align: justify;">
During a class discussion, Ji-Woo corrected Mr. Kim's solution to a problem, applying a lesson learned from Hak-Seong about addressing incorrect solutions. However, Mr. Kim reprimanded Ji-Woo, emphasising the importance of providing the expected solution rather than just a technically correct one. By the way, I was unsure what the question Ji-Woo mentioned on logarithms was about since it was in Korean and Google Translate did not do an accurate job. Despite Ji-Woo's efforts to explain his perspective, he was eventually asked to leave the classroom. Later, Ji-Woo informed Mr. Kim of his decision not to transfer to another class.

On a different occasion, Hak-Seong's friend, Gi-Cheol, gave him a smartphone to enhance his accessibility and everyday convenience. Hak-Seong happily shows Ji-Woo a thesis on his phone, but it was too small for him. There was a glimpse of the sum of divisors function, $\sigma(n)$ on the screen. Note that $\sigma(n)$ is defined by the equation \[\sigma(n)=\sum_{d|n}d,\] where $d$ is a divisor of $n$. Ji-Woo’s friend helped to sneak into the computer lab to print the thesis and Hak-Seong received it as a gift. The latter was grateful. The thesis was titled
        'A Study of Möbius Divisor Functions and Ordered Divisor Functions'. I was quite confused at this because neither the Möbius Divisor Function nor an ordered divisor function exists in Mathematics. The former could mean the Möbius Function, $\mu(n)$, which is defined as follows: \[\mu(n)=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }n\text{ has one or more repeated prime factors;}\\ 1&\text{if }n=1;\\(-1)^k&\text{if }n\text{ is a product of }k\text{ distinct primes}\end{cases}\]
        This is a very important function in Analytic Number Theory. As for 'ordered divisor function', the closest thing that came to my mind was on the concept of the average order of an arithmetic function.
        A function $f$ is said to be an arithmetic function if $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$. Again, here we take $\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. So, for an arithmetic function $f$, the average order of $f$ is $g$ if \[\underset{x\to \infty }{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n\le x}{f\left( n \right)}}{\displaystyle \sum\limits_{n\le x}{g\left( n \right)}}=1.\]

The following day marked the Pythagoras Award test, and as mentioned, it was a significant event for students. Ji-Woo was doing well thanks to Hak-Seong. However, during the exam, Bo-Ram abruptly left the classroom in frustration. She discovered that the questions from the practice tests provided by Mr. Kim during her private tutoring session were identical to those on the actual test. Following her mother's instructions, Bo-Ram stayed home, her absence masked by a fabricated trip.

<div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
Despite Ji-Woo's attempts to reach out, Bo-Ram remained unresponsive. Later that evening, Ji-Woo and Hak-Seong attended a classical concert. The tickets were sponsored by Bo-Ram's family. However, Bo-Ram didn't show up. Hak-Seong was deeply moved by a cello performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's 'Cello Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007: I. Prelude’. After the concert, he invited Ji-Woo to his home for dinner. Ji-Woo also observed the turtle in Hak-Seong's tank.</div>


    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
    That same night, the Pythagoras Award questions were leaked on the Internet, causing distress among the teachers. They faced the threat of being fired if they couldn't identify the student responsible. Mr. Kim, in particular, appeared visibly worried. Ji-Woo and Hak-Seong visited a bookstore, where Hak-Seong purchased three books on Number Theory. They were ‘Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem’ by Ian Stewart and David Tall, ‘Methods of Solving Number Theory Problems’ by Ellina Grigorieva and ‘Elementary Number Theory’ by David Burton. It seemed quite odd as to why Hak-Seong purchased books of varying difficulty. Algebraic Number Theory is a rather difficult branch of Mathematics (needless to say Fermat’s Last Theorem), whereas the other two books seemed more like an introductory course material.
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
In the bookstore, a chance encounter brought an unexpected twist to Hak-Seong and Ji-Woo's evening. A stranger named Park Pil-Ju recognised Hak-Seong, claiming that he had been Hak-Seong's student back in North Korea at Kim Il-Sung University, where Hak-Seong had served as a Mathematics lecturer. Pil-Ju mistook Ji-Woo for Lee Tae-Yeon, Hak-Seong's son, adding an air of confusion to the conversation. Despite Pil-Ju's attempts to engage further, Hak-Seong seemed reluctant to delve into his past, steering the conversation away from the topic. Later, when Ji-Woo probed Hak-Seong about his history and the identity of Tae-Yeon, Hak-Seong evaded the questions. At home, Hak-Seong's mind wandered back to happier times spent with his son, recalling cherished memories like shared dinners, buying a pet turtle, and the simple act of buying strawberry milk, Tae-Yeon's favorite drink.

        Subsequently, the television broadcast announced that the Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most significant problems in Mathematics, was on the verge of being solved by a North Korean, Lee Hak-Seong. ‘The zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part $1/2$, announced the newscaster. The formula \[\zeta(x)=\prod_{p}\frac{p^x}{p^x-1}\] flashed on the screen. One can easily derive this formula from the definition of the zeta function, i.e. \[\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}=\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\frac{p^s}{p^s-1}.\]

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
The proof by Hak-Seong will take around two years to validate by scholars. Also, the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts (CMI) will award the solver with USD 1 million. The news also showed an interview with POSTECH’s Mathematics Chair Professor, Oh Jung-Nam. He mentioned that he met Hak-Seong at the International Mathematical Olympiad. Hak-Seong represented North Korea, whereas Jung-Nam represented the south. They also had a group photo with Paul Erdős. Erdős called them ‘epsilons’. Also, both Hak-Seong and Jung-Nam received a fountain pen each from Erdős. Ji-Woo runs to find Hak-Seong and talks about the Riemann Hypothesis.     </div>

    <div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 32px;">
Meanwhile, rumors swirled about the leak of the Pythagoras Award, and Mr. Kim was worried about his reputation. A student spotted Ji-Woo on a security tape, carrying documents out of the computer lab, casting suspicion on him. When confronted by Mr. Kim, Ji-Woo vehemently denied any involvement in the leak of the test, explaining that the documents were a part of a mathematical thesis. Despite Ji-Woo’s claims, Mr. Kim remained skeptical and was unable to understand how he had suddenly become proficient in mathematics. He convinced Ji-Woo to transfer or be publicly blamed for the incident. <br><br> The rumors about Ji-Woo continued to spread. Bo-Ram, aware of Ji-Woo's innocence, felt a surge of frustration at the injustice unfolding. In the meantime, North Korea accused the south of stealing Hak-Seong's achievements, labeling him as a victim of southern spies. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) intervened, pressuring Gi-Cheol to persuade Hak-Seong to appear on television and clarify the truth. Gi-Cheol, burdened with guilt, visited Hak-Seong to apologise for failing to keep the NIS at bay. Despite the circumstances, Hak-Seong remained grateful for the years of protection he had received. As Hak-Seong prepared to leave town, Gi-Cheol returned the research document that Hak-Seong had almost burned three years ago, after the tragic death of his son. <br><br> Outside Hak-Seong's residence, Ji-Woo overheard Hak-Seong shouting. Hak-Seong blamed the research into the Riemann Hypothesis for his son's death and refused to put it on television, haunted by the painful memories of the past. When Gi-Cheol left, Ji-Woo attempted to talk to Hak-Seong, but Hak-Seong lashed out, consumed by the belief that they were all only after their own lives. Later that night, as Ji-Woo walked down the streets, he received a call from Bo-Ram. She couldn’t comprehend why he was willing to be framed. Ji-Woo, his voice heavy with resignation, told her that it was over and hung up. At the bus station, Hak-Seong, ready to leave town, saw by a passerby who bore a striking resemblance to Tae-Yeon. The sight triggered painful memories of the night he died. The heated argument between father and son, Tae-Yeon's defiance, and his tragic attempt to swim back to the North — all of it came flooding back to Hak-Seong, leaving him haunted by the past and the choices that had led them to this point.

Ji-Woo sneaked home and used his mother’s stamp on the transfer papers. The next morning, he hands them to Mr. Kim, who tells him he did the right thing. Hak-Seong was surprised to receive a call from Bo-Ram who informed him about Ji-Woo’s transfer. It was the day of the Pythagoras Award prize presentation. Ji-Woo was already on his way out of the campus but Bo-Ram suddenly arrives and drags him with her to the auditorium by stealing his luggage. At the award ceremony, Professor Jung-Nam, the guest of honor, spoke about the Riemann Hypothesis and Hak-Seong's remarkable progress in solving it. Just as Jung-Nam was into his speech, Hak-Seong entered the auditorium, brandishing the fountain pen given to him by Erdős. Jung-Nam, initially stunned, revealed his own pen and welcomed Hak-Seong warmly. In a surprising confession, Hak-Seong revealed that he had been teaching Ji-Woo Mathematics all along, and it was Ji-Woo who had printed the thesis in the computer lab. To everyone's shock, Hak-Seong exposed Mr. Kim as the one who leaked the Pythagoras Award test, causing Mr. Kim to leave in disgrace.

Hak-Seong recounted his reasons for defecting to South Korea: he wanted to study mathematics without his research being used for destructive purposes. However, this decision led to the tragic death of his son. Full of remorse, Hak-Seong publicly apologised and thanked Ji-Woo for his unwavering loyalty, promising to keep their interactions a secret till the very end. Outside the auditorium, Gi-Cheol, who had been waiting, presented Hak-Seong with a new legal passport, marking him as a South Korean citizen. In the aftermath of these revelations, Gi-Cheol visited Ji-Woo, delivering Hak-Seong's fountain pen and the first draft of his Riemann Hypothesis thesis. Ji-Woo shared this significant moment with Bo-Ram, and both admired the precious gifts.
